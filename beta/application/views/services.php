    	<h2>Rail - Service</h2>
    	<p>
        About 4 years ago Nick and Luke DeMenna of DeMenna Cranes had a simple, but brilliant idea. Frustrated by the time in which it took to move material from depot to work site on the railway, they initiated the design of a Crane Truck which could travel most of the way on the road, mount the track at a level crossing and complete its journey by rail. Thus the DeMenna Cranes High Rail Crane truck was born, and the idea was soon extended to include a Rail Trailer to carry more material on track saving the customer time and money. The High Rail Crane truck has added a new dimension to railway infrastructure engineering in Australia.<br><br>

        <h2>Construction </h2>
        <p>
        DeMenna Cranes has been providing Crane trucks, heavy haulage and personnel in the construction industry since 1990, servicing everyone from the smallest job to multibillion dollar jobs throughout Victoria and Australia. Mr Nick DeMenna (Director) saw an opportunity to improve delivery of service to the market to reduce high running costs and congestion on construction sites.  This involved providing a complete service to the customer to meet their requirements.<br><br>

		Nick decided on building a new fleet of Crane Trucks and Crane Semis with large HMF Cranes fitted, capable of any task required on a construction site, saving the clients money due to the hiring of one machine to do the whole job (pick up, transport and deliver/unload). Our team consists of Intermediate Riggers, Dogman, Crane operators, Site supervisors, and Labourers.<br><br>

		There’s no job too big or small, DeMenna Cranes Can do it all.
